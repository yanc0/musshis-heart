# Musshi's Heart
You drive the heart oh a little creature called: Musshi.

Developed for the [50th Ludum Dare Game Jam: Delay The Inevitable](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/musshis-heart)

## Goal

Every Musshi wants to find love and die peacefully, but they are very fragile. The goal is to maintain heartbeats per minute close to the Musshi's needs. Every heart failure decreases Musshi's life expectancy. Are you gonna make it survive long enough to find love ?
